# JARVIS ASSISTANT

Jarvis Assistant is a voice-enabled virtual assistant designed to simplify daily tasks through natural language interaction. Built using Python, it leverages speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, and OpenAI's ChatGPT to provide a seamless conversational experience. The assistant can perform a variety of tasks, including opening websites, launching desktop applications, playing songs on YouTube, and searching for information on platforms like Google, YouTube, Instagram, and LinkedIn. It also provides intelligent responses to general queries using ChatGPT.
The project features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with PyQt6, allowing users to interact with Jarvis via both voice and text commands. Key functionalities include wake-word detection, real-time feedback, and error handling for a smooth user experience. Jarvis Assistant is designed to be cross-platform, supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux.
This project demonstrates the integration of AI-powered conversational interfaces with task automation, making it a practical tool for enhancing productivity and accessibility. Its modular architecture allows for easy customization and extension, enabling users to adapt it to their specific needs.
